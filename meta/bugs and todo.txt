Bugs:
1): http://localhost:8080/#book2 renders "<!doctype html>"
Fixed: URL verification implemented

Todo:
1): Make the function/app something you need to initialise to run and add the possibility to add the prefix of the url when initiating the call to the function.
Done: v0.0.5.

2): Check if I can require the file and run it with the init function or if Webpack has already internalised the entry file, thus making that a default call it always already runs
(which it should not).
Done: v0.1.0. Seperated out and maintained this opportunity if the application is ever used as a module. See documentation.
